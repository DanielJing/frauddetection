## Error Analyses of 2 ML Methods: XGBoost & Deep Learning

For a given dataset, I conducted Error Analysis for 2 types of ML algorithms: 1. XGBoost & 2. Deep Learning.
I created one file for Data Preprocessing, one file for the XGBoost version, and the other for Deep Learning.
I used an Error Analysis tool provided by the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santiagxf/E72102/master/docs/develop/modeling/selection/code/error_analysis.txt
